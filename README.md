SEC RPG GAME:

Here's how the app works:

1. When the game starts, the player will choose a team by clicking on the team's picture. The player will fight as that team for the rest of the game.

2. The player must then defeat all of the remaining teams. Opponents should be moved to a different area of the screen.

3. The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an team's picture.

4. Once the player selects an opponent, that opponent is moved to a defender area.

5.The player will now be able to click the attack button.
    
    -- Whenever the player clicks attack, their team damages the defender. The opponent will lose HP (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture. 
    -- The opponent team will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's team will lose some of their HP.          These points are shown at the bottom of the player team's picture.

6. The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.
    
    -- When the defender's HP is reduced to zero or below, remove the opposing team from the defender area. The player character can now choose a new opponent.

7. The player wins the game by defeating all of the opposing teams. The player loses the game the game if their character's HP falls to zero or below.
